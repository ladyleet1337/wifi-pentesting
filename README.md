Wifi Penetration Testing of Home Network



## Secure My WiFi Network

1. Change Default Password on Router
  - Change the default password on router using new secure password.

Need to read up on password complexity, what makes a good password for encryption.

  A. Method 1 - Diceware
  - Use [Diceware Word List](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.wordlist.asc) and [Dice Roller](https://www.random.org/dice/) to roll 5 dice four times. Each resulting roll will be the key to a random word in list.
  - Insert some special character (e.g. '$', '!', '^', etc.) between each of four words.
  - Add a fifth sequence of characters (alphanumeric and symbols) that has personal meaning onto end of password.
  - Evaluation: Seems susceptible to dictionary attacks, especially for diceware words.

2. Enable Network Encrpytion
  - Enable WPA2 encrpytion on the router. Do not use WEP as it is highly insecure.
  - Generate a secure password for WPA2 encryption.



## Penetration Testing Hardware

### Choosing the Right Wireless Card for Me

[My Wireless Adapter Card](http://www.amazon.com/Alfa-AWUS036NHA-Wireless-Adaptor-Compatible/dp/B004Y6MIXS)

1. Requirements and Constraints
  - Operating System: Macbook Pro (Can dual boot into Windows or Linux)
  - Preferred Hardware Format: USB
  - Features require: Listening and Injection

2. Learn the basics of a wireless card
  - Brand of card iteself
  - Manufacturer who makes wireless chipset within card

3. Determine the chipset
  - Atheros chipset is one of best chipsets, well supported under Linux and Windows

4. Verify the chipset capabilities
  - [Compatibility Section](http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compatibility_drivers#compatibility)
  - determine what features chipset provides for particular operating system

5. Determine the drivers and patches required
  - drivers required for chipset and operating system
  - [Patching Drivers Tutorial](http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=patching)
  - can also use backtrack or kali linux with already patched drivers

6. Select a card
